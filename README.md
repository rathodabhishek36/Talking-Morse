# Talking-Morse
According to the global report published by the World Federation of the Deafblind (WFDB) around 0.2% of the world’s population is living with severe deaf-blindness. Analysis of prevalence data also found that 2% of the world’s population lives with ‘milder forms’ of deaf-blindness. Without the ability to see, hear or speak, the deafblind can't express themselves. Talking Morse is an app which empowers them to communicate with family, friends or anyone else through their smartphones.

Talking Morse uses Morse Code which allows deafblind to chat with people. In Morse Code, letters are represented as a combination of dots and dashes. The deafblind person inputs a dot by tapping at the left of the screen, dash by tapping on the right of the screen to form a message and tapping at the right edge will separate letters of the message and tapping it twice sends the message. While, a person with normal sight and hearing can input a message as text that is received as a combination of short (dot) and long (dash) vibrations, which the deafblind can interpret.
